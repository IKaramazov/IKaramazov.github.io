Got some bad news today. It's a long fight I'm not sure I have the strength to endure.

I told E. Who did not remember much about the situation or care. 

We almost broke up. We're going to start making changes but I'm not hopeful it will work. We've been down this path before. 

There may be some fall out in a few days. I think that I should keep getting rid of things, keeping my important things close.

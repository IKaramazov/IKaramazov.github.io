Today was very productive. While I have not completed the project I have finished all but the last section of the coding for my Dog Breed Classifier. I have to tweak my CNN architecture, my transfer learning architecture, answer some questions, and run it on six of my own photos still but they are all simple tasks that I think I'll be able to finish tomorrow.

I would like to research CNNs to figure out how to make the best architecture that I can think of. I only need 1% accuracy to pass the requirements, and I'm at 2.99-4% right now, but I'd like to actually learn more about the different layers, activations, etc. 

I've been thinking about that Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit paper that I read a few days ago. Trying to think creatively about different methods for pushing ML to making a intuitive leap and coming up with logic for examples it hasn't seen before. 

I guess that's the dream, isn't it? True artificial intelligence. Right now we have these idiot-savant algorithms that can recall information but cannot extrapolate. 

Nothing so far, not that I expected to have some brilliant idea. Everything that I have thought of is some kind of method that I feel is against the spirit of machine learning. An arbitrary system I've come up with that isn't truly data driven. How do I set up the environment where the algorithm must solve problems creatively?

For now I've found a neuroscience paper on creativity that I hope will give me some ideas. I've also been thinking about a strange paper I read a few years ago about setting up chips to learn to complete a task with absolutely no instructions. Over thousands of iterations the chips own physical form guides a sort of programming. I wish that I could find it but I'm drawing a blank on the name and the authors. It might even have a been a popular science article and not a paper at all.

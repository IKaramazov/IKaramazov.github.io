<h1>First blog post</h1>
<p>2018-08-03</p>
<p>Today I am attempting to install and use jekyll for my blog posts. So far so good, but I'm not sure it isn't more hassle than just writing it in straight html.</p>
<p>Also saw a therapist for the first time today. I don't think that she's a good fit. I will try another session next week then look for someone else if I still don't feel it's a good match.</p>

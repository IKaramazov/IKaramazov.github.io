Today I am attempting to install and use jekyll for my blog posts. So far so good, but I'm not sure it isn't more hassle than just writing it in straight html.

Also saw a therapist for the first time today. I don't think that she's a good fit. I will try another session next week then look for someone else if I still don't feel it's a good match.

I keep thinking about Bartleby the Scrivener by Herman Melville. I've read it but I don't think that I understood it. I still have no idea. Literary analysis has always been a mystery to me. I like books because of the way they make me feel. 

My mom told me that one of her literary friends said that she was just like Bartleby. 

I keep thinking about him, sitting on the floor in that barren office, was it in the dark? Just repeating "I'd prefer not to" when asked. 

What did her friend mean?

Of course they're both dead now. I'll certainly never know what he meant. And I remember talking to Mom about that story but I don't remember what she said. So I'll never know what she thought of it either. 

I suppose one can never guess what's going on in another person's head.

I keep having fantasies about suicide. Thinking about who I'd leave a note, what I'd say. I think about how I'll do it. 

Sometimes I think about getting cryogenically frozen and brought back. Not as I am now, with my memories intact, but maybe they could mix some of what I've left behind into a soup and use that to clone me. After all wouldn't consciousness be physical? Maybe it'd be me, without all this... whatever it is. A sort of reincarnation for atheists.

It's strange but these dark thoughts are comforting to me. I suppose in a way I can imagine all the people in my life thinking of me in a loving way. Starting over in some wonderful future. 

I think I should probably stop but they're so tempting. Half the time I don't even realize I'm doing it until afterward. I do remember doing the same thing when I was growing up. Maybe if I'd spent more time fantasizing about being married, having a job I wouldn't be so lost now. 

I've been lying to my therapist. She asked me directly if I was thinking about harming myself and I said no. I wonder if she could see through me? I feel like I lie so often, to so many people. Am I good at it?

I don't want to lose my rights or be committed. I can't afford to really. There's no one I can trust in my family. If they stole all my money and left me destitute I probably would do it. Things really aren't that bad and I'm struggling.

For the past few weeks I've been searching for a novel source of data demonstrating creativity. I've found a few articles about creativity from neuroscience journals. And while at the courthouse serving jury duty I found that article about the spontaneous evolution of chips to solve problems I've been looking for. 

I'm still looking. Not sure if I'll find anything. But I feel the key is to find the right data. Maybe there's some underlying method? Or are random physical characteristics what drives creativity? Maybe a unreliable node could help model creativity?

The days seem to go so quickly and I accomplish so little. 

I miss feeling happy.

Yesterday was tough. I was anxious before the meeting with the lawyer. I tried to do this breathing technique that my therapist suggested but I think it works better when you have racing thoughts. This time what I was feeling was more physical than mental. I think that it made it a bit worse actually.

The meeting went fine. I think that I will probably hire him. I've got to stop putting off contacting my other lawyer. I've got too many lawyers in my life right now. 

E. wanted to hang out with friends last night. I didn't feel up for it but I went anyway. It was nice seeing them but I got tired quickly. They're all night owls and I've been getting up earlier and earlier these days.

Today I've decided to start working on the next project, generating a tv script from the Simpsons TV show. I'm leaving in a month and I don't want to be behind on projects or needing to catch up when I get back.

Update: Somehow it slipped my mind that I had jury duty this morning. I remembered around noon. I called the courthouse and rescheduled for tomorrow. I better not forget again. 

I'm not looking forward to it but I believe my natural spleenishness will probably get me excluded. Hopefully I'll only miss half a day of work.

Another good day for studying. I was able to complete the Anna KaRNNa notebook and I understood the section I read in Deep Learning. I do have a bug somewhere that's preventing me from training the network but I went over all the parts and feel that I understand what is going on. Tomorrow I'm going to focus on debugging, reading the section from Andrej Karpathy and optimizing my hyperparamaters.

I realize the question that I asked the other day was rather stupid. No wonder I didn't get a good response. I feel somewhat embarrassed about it. 

I have to admit that I think I was struggling with lack of sleep and an inability to concentrate and abosrb material due to being in ketosis. The ketogenic diet really is not working for me. I just can't think on it.

It is the most effective diet for weight loss. I already feel that I'm retaining water and eating too much again. For now I'm going to try to get 20,000 steps a day and I might start experimenting with intermitent fasting.

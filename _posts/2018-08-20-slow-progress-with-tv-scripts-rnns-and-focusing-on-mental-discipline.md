I've been stuck on the get_inputs step in the generate TV script project. I feel like I'm not following the notebook very well. As in I'm not reading the code correctly and following along. 

I asked about it in the mentor chat but the response didn't answer my question. I just guessed the shape was [2,2] for both the inputs and the targets, and the shape of the learning rate is None. I'm not certain that these are correct. This passes the tests but I don't know if it's going to work out later.

I feel like programming is my main weakness. It must be trivial for someone with better programming skills to see what is going on with the notebook. I've got to get better at reading other people's code. 

I've been slowly rewatching the intro to RNN videos. I'm embarrassed to say that I find the instructor's voice soporific and get sleepy while watching. It's something about her cadence and voice. It's just so soothing. I feel bad about it but I've taken to turning off the volume and playing the video with subtitles. The instruction itself is quite detailed and clear and I feel like I'm learning this way.

My mental clarity and concentration have been absolutely terrible. I'm trying very hard not to be distracted by my ruminations. I read something about the people who commit suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge in an article the other day. They were described as being like children, who have fantasies of jumping off and being transformed somehow. It really struck a chord in me. As much as I hate to admit it. I fantasize too much. Always wishing for something to happen to transform me, or the world around me. Or just take me away to some nonexistent heaven. I need to work on being more practical. Living here, now.

I think the first step to that is having a disciplined mind. I wasn't able to stop myself from ruminating today but I did try. Hopefully I will get better with practice.

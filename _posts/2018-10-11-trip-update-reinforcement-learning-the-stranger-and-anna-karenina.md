I'm leaving for Thailand the day after tomorrow. I have mixed feelings about going back. Not even excited really.

Still, the change of pace will probably be good. At least I'll be out of the house for a week. And I'm planning to take some 4K videos around Bangkok. Maybe I'll enjoy that if I can work up the energy to do it.

I submitted my DCGAN project but it still has some errors. The most frustrating of which is some issue with scope that's screwing up passing in the correct information to my placeholder for the image tensor. I feel like I've tried every combination of variables to make it work but I just keep getting the same error. I really want to get to the training part of the network. At this point I think it might be better to just start over. 

Instead of working on that today I started the section on reinforcement learning. It looks really cool! I actually feel some excitement about getting started. I can't wait until I can start applying what I've learned to my own projects.

I've also been reading a lot and finished The Stranger by Camus and Anna Karenina.

The Stranger was nothing like I thought it would be. I knew that it is often mentioned when speaking of nihilism, and I knew that it would be disturbing but I'm disappointed with it somehow. I've avoided it for so many years thinking that it would have a negative effect on my mental health. Perhaps I've just built it up too much in my mind all these years. No book could be what I imagined it was. Only the actual The King in Yellow from the short story of the same name would have sufficed.

Anna Karenina actually struck a greater chord of horror within me. I think because I can relate so well to Anna's situation. This conflict about leaving, change, disgrace, and uncertainty of the future. I did not suspect the ending until the last part of the book, and the description of Anna's innermost thoughts was quite difficult for me to read. 

I also get so tired of being miserable all the time. I can relate to wanting to rid myself of my self.

I don't think it was a good book for me to read right now.

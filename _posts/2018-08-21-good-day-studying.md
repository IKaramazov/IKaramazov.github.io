I'm not sure if it was my resolution yesterday or my recent dietary changes but I got a lot of good studying in today. Also, I feel much happier. 

I have been trying to focus on the work and disrupt my negative thinking before I spiral into a bad mood and become unproductive. I wasn't totally successful but I did make some progress with it. With practice I seem to be getting better. 

Of course there is the possibility this is because I have been eating more carbohydrates. I normally eat a ketogenic diet but this week I fell off the wagon. I have been eating gluten free and somewhat low-carb but definitely not keto. Changes that I have noticed are that I slept a lot better these past few days. My concentration has improved. But, I seem a bit softer around the middle despite getting more steps in during the day. I wish I could find an optimum balance. 

Today I finished reviewing the Recurrent Neural Networks section in the Udacity course and the Long Short Term Memory Networks section. This is a lot more progress than I've made over the previous few days. I think this is probably due to focusing on the Udacity lessons and taking a break from my books. While I'd like to keep reading on my own I think I need to focus on one book at a time. At least one big textbook at a time. Since I started the Deep Learning book first I think I will continue reading that. Then I will start reading Probability Theory again once I'm finished. 

Next in the Udacity course I will work on the Anna Karenina project. Which I'm pretty excited about. I feel much more mentally alert and prepared than I did when I started it last week.

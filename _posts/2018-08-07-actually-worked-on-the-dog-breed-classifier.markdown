Actually made some progress on the Dog Breed Classifier today. I tested the provided dog breed classifier and human faces recognizer. Next I'm actually building the architecture for my CNN. I'm excited to actually be working on this at last! 

I did give in and decided to just use the project notebook that Udacity provides. I kept having strange problems because I was on a Windows machine. I suppose that I could try using my hd with Ubuntu installed, but it hasn't been booting up properly and I'd have to fix it first. 

Also I found out that one of my graphics cards isn't working today when I tried to set up my miner. I'm having so many hardware problems lately.

My partner made a nasty comment about me that hit me out of nowhere. I thought we were getting along. I left to go walk around Target and ran on my treadmill for a bit when I got back. I don't like how much it distracted me. We're not talking right now.

I finished the Probability theory section of Deep Learning. Most of it was completely new to me and a bit over my head. To combat this I ordered Probability Theory: The Logic of Science which will hopefully go into greater depth so that I can learn the concepts. 

Last, I went to the orthodontist today. I'm getting invisilign! It wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be but treatment will take a little longer than I expected. 1.5 years. Then I will get the two posts installed, and in six months I'll have the full smile I've always wanted.

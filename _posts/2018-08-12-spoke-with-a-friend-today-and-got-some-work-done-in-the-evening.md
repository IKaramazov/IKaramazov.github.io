I spent some time with a friend doing chores today. We actually had a deep discussion about some of the things that have been bothering me lately. I feel a lot lighter today.

Also I found a good tutorial on how to get tensorflow-gpu up and running on Ubuntu 16.04. Tomorrow I think that I should be able to get back to coding and finish up my project.

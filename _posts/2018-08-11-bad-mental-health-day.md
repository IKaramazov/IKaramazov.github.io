I feel brittle today. Like even the smallest thing will take me out. I keep thinking about all the ways that I've wasted my life. It's become a physical sensation, this sting deep in my chest whenever something reminds me of it. I try so hard and it all just crumbles away. 

I saw my therapist again yesterday. She brought in this board game to help open up discussion. It was a therapy game and had different tiles that made you ask a question, come up with one, or read out an aphorism. I think it did help us speak more openly. 

I do feel a little more positive about our upcoming sessions, and have decided to continue for now.   

She asked me if I watched Big Bang Theory, which I guess is something I remind her of. I have mixed feelings about that. One, if the characters are all BioChemists and Neuroscientists I am certainly not as educated as all that. Maybe I just come off as pretentious? 

She also said that I look and seem sad. I didn't know that about myself. It must be off putting? Do I act that way recently, or has it been for a long time?

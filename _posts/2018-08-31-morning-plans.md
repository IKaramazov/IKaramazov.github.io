I've gotten off track recently but I hope that today I will be able to focus once again. 

Last night was great. I found this old python programming challenge website and I've been going through it but focusing on solving the challenges using numpy. It's really the best way for me to learn. 

I am actually enjoying it. I feel kind of like a kid again. Programming is fun when it comes down to it. What else gives you such instant gratification? It's perfect for me since I mostly enjoy figuring things out and not building things. 

Okay I had a couple of bad days but I'm trying to start fresh and think positively. I ate a healthy breakfast. I'm going to open up my TV scripts project and get started working on that. I'm already in my jogging gear so when I get stuck I will exercise. I have therapy at 11AM. I usually feel kind of bad afterward but today I will relax and listen to music.

If I still want to apply to the Physics programs for Spring 2019 I have until the end of the day. Not sure if I should do it or focus on Fall. I don't feel ready, honestly. And I haven't been thinking about Physics lately.

I've been thinking more and more about ML. Maybe going through the Udacity AI program instead. Maybe switching back to my first interest and studying cognition. Going to grad school. I'm not sure but I think it's a mistake to make a move until I'm in a better place. When I was studying physics before things turned to shit I was really happy. 

For now I think I'll just keep working on the Deep Learning program and improving my programming skills.

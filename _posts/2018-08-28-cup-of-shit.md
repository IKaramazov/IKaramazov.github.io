When I first drank from the cup it was overwhelming. Too bright, sweet, and bitter all at once. But I was eager and wanted more. I could see darkness in it, but I thought there was light too.

More and more I pulled from the cup. There were terrible things in it but there were beautiful things as well and I was still wanting. 

For years I pulled and drank deeply of the cup. But the sweetness became less and less frequent. The bitterness so prevasive I lost my taste for it. 

Now the cup dribbles a foul liquid that I am gagging down. I keep hoping to get through it, that there is something more, some goodness left after all the shit. But I think I lost my chance long ago and now there is only shit. My hope is waning slowly and turning into routine. 

I want to step away now. I miss the sweetness, the way it used to feel on the inside. I even miss wanting.

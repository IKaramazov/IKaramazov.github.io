Today was good. I woke up refreshed, jogged, and got a lot of good studying done in the morning. I feel like I'm really grasping the concepts in my ML class. 

I did have some problems installing my new motherboard and cpu. Apparently the motherboard uses DDR4 ram and all I had was DDR3. Of course I realized this right when Fry's closed. No matter, I ordered some and my desktop will soon be up and running again. Hopefully without the shutting down issue that has been plaguing me.

I do feel a lot better today. Maybe the therapist was better than I thought?

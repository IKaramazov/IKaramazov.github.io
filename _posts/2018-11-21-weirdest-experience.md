Last night I had some trouble sleeping. I was in bed but I don't feel like I was falling asleep. 

All of a sudden I felt like I heard someone loudly call my name, even though I didn't hear anything. 

It was a little disturbing.

I wonder if it's a bit like deja vu, or that feeling you get of falling right as you go to sleep?

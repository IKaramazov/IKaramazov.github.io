This morning I jogged on the Golden Gate Bridge again. Well, I jogged and walked. As one would expect with a bridge there's an incline for the first half. I'm not used to it and it's hard for me to jog at my regular pace during that stretch. Today it was actually pretty clear and gave the bridge a different atmosphere. I would still like to get there a bit earlier in the future but I think it was less busy than last week.

The security guard checked up on me while I was walking. Kind of awkward. He just asked me a question and left me alone after that. I might try a different place next week. I missed the fog. I think it makes the experience a little more private.

When I got back I was able to complete my embeddings notebook for the Udacity course. I have some strange bug that prevented me from using it to train, but since I'd finished all the coding anyway I just trained on the sample notebook. I'm sure it's just some stupid mistake somewhere. Or it might be some issue with the kernel. I'm still using the dog project kernel for my notebooks. I'm not sure how to set up a new one. 

I only have the sentiment notebook left to do in the RNN section of the course.

I was able to reread the cost function and output unit sections in Deep Learning and actually retain it today. I'm still not sure about the other outputs section. I got kind of lost. Not sure if it's worth reading now. I might come back to it later. Also I started on the hidden units and architectural design sections today. 

I think I'll probably continue to read this way. Reread about ten pages to review then read another ten. Actually the sections seem to be about twelve pages usually. I like to finish concepts rather than stopping in the middle.

I have to say that Maxout units seem incredibly clever. I might read the paper. Not sure if I'm up for it yet.

I wish I had someone to talk to about what I'm learning. A mentor would be incredible, but even someone to discuss it with would be nice. 

But I'm such a dullard honestly. Or perhaps I'm just not what you'd expect. Whenever I try to speak to someone I just end up struggling to communicate and end up more discouraged in the end. I often regret that I tried to reach out or say anything at all.

Lastly, I brewed a much better cup this morning. I think it was still a tad underextracted but I think I've got the grind nearly dialed in. It had a pleasant lingering quality today that was not present in the last two cups.

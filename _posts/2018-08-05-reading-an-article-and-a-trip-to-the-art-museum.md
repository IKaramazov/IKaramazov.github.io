It was not a productive day in terms of studying. For some reason I feel very drained. I did try to read this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00508">article</a>. I understood the general concepts but I had trouble with most of the specifics. 

I also went to the local art museum today. It was fun but I don't think I will be back unless they host a particularly interesting exhibit. It just doesn't compare to visiting the Louvre or the British museum. 

I am getting a second wind after installing my new ram and getting my computer back up and running. I'm going to work on catching up on the programming assignments in the coursera course.

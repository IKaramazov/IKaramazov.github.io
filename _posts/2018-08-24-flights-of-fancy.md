I had a sort of average day. I did't feel great but I pushed through it and I did complete the hyperparameter section in the Deep Learning Nanodegree. 

It was a straight forward section. Mostly it went over what starting values to use and tips on how to optimize your hyperparameters. With the TV scripts project coming up I'm sure it will be useful.

I also started on chapter 6 of Deep Learning. Let me summarize. It started off with a definition of Deep neural networks and how they differ from machine learning. It's the hidden layer really that makes them unique. You can stack the layers which is sort of like stacking functions. Well, not stacking. The output of one function is the input to another. Nested? Composed functions? I forget the terminology.

One key insight is that because the functions are composed they can represent non-linear relationships. One example that the book went over was the XOR operation. 

Which I think must be a standard example in Deep Learning because the Nanodegree program used this as an example as well. It was nice to see it presented in a different way.

Then there was a short section on gradient descent. Not really explaining it, but because deep learning makes functions that are not convex you must use an interative method to find the global minimum. Which I vaguely remember going over in calculus.

I don't feel accomplished but I think it is important that I learn to work even when I don't feel like it. Hopefully it will become habitual.

I had a therapy session this morning. Maybe that's why I feel so crummy. We started talking about my relationship, then my family relationships, and we ended the session talking about my dad.

I guess it makes me sad sometimes when I think about it. I did feel closest to him growing up, and of anyone in this world I feel like I am most like him. But he's got a new family now and doesn't want to be reminded of his failed marriage. I loved my father very much. But he doesn't want me around anymore. So I let him go. 

And that's about it for today. Oh, I also finally got some coffee beans and made some this morning. It's been so long I messed it up somehow and it was a bit sour today. I think I used too much water, or I could adjust the grind to be smaller. Tomorrow I will try again. 

Funny story, when I was walking back to my car from the roasters the other day when this random person asked me to go with him on a first class ticket to the moon. I thought he was going to ask me for a dollar. I laughed and told him I was busy. He told me that he was scared but he'd go without me.

Here I am trying to be less dreamy and these flights of fancy seem to find me.

I only got 3.5 hours of sleep last night despite all the steps I've taken to improve it. I don't feel fatigued exactly but I can't help think that it's impacting how well I absorb new material.

I worked all day and got almost nothing accomplished on my Dog Breed classification project. My mistake thinking that I could just install all the dependencies. I'm not sure what OpenCV is but while I was able to install it easily enough I couldn't get the notebook to find the module. At one point I gave up and set up an AWS instance. Which I suppose is good to know if I'm ever away from my desktop but I really wanted to test out my new motherboard, cpu, and ram.

In the end I just decided to follow the set up instructions in the readme file exactly, and that solved the OpenCV problem. So silly. I could have set it up this morning in thirty minutes and worked on the actual project today. Lesson learned, I suppose.

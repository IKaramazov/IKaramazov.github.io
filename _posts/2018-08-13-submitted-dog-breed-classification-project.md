I submitted my project! On the class discussion forum I found out how to upload some of my own pictures in order to complete the last section of the notebook. Thank goodness, as it appears that my home set up is simply incapable of handling the rigor of this particular notebook. I got some weird memory error that I think I need a better GPU in order to fix. Maybe I should try to use AWS next time? 

I feel so relieved. I've even read a little more in my Deep Learning book which I'm been too overwhelmed to do of late. Maybe having this project deadline creeping ever closer is what has been depressing me lately. I do feel happier now. 

There might be some changes that I still need to implement on my Dog Breed Classifier but I am hopeful that those will be simple to do.

I find out in about a half hour whether I'll have to serve jury duty this week. Hopefully not, as I have an appointment to see a fiduciary lawyer tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to that but it will be even more of a pain if I need to reschedule. 

Update: My project passed! On to the next one :).

This morning I drove to the Golden Gate Bridge. I've actually never walked or biked across. I guess that's common when you grow up in the area.

I was surprised by the statues and plaques. For some reason I just thought there would be a walkway and that it wouldn't be much of a tourist spot. How wrong I was! There are two cafes and a visitor center. And on the north side a scenic viewpoint. 

Thankfully at 5:30AM it was almost empty, even on a Sunday. Just the way that I like San Francisco best. All the scenery without the crowds. With the dense fog it was beautiful but eerie. The bridge seemed to be the only thing in the world while I was walking on it.  

I had a lovely walk. Up close you see that it is in the Art Deco style. I thought a bit of Metropolis and Ayn Rand. Not that I particularly like Rand, but I did feel surrounded by industry!

Things liven up a lot around 7AM. There were two policemen driving on the path and maybe a dozen people walking or running. I hope to get there a bit earlier next time. I'll jog more too. Which will help me finish before the other joggers arrive. I'm not used to waking up so early and I think it made me a little light headed.

I did study a lot today but mostly reading and not much working on problems. Unfortunately I've been distracted. I'll have to read the last ten pages of Probability Theory again. I don't think I absorbed it all that well. 

I am very excited to learn more about the Bayesian approach. I feel like I've only been exposed to the frequentist view and it never sat well with me. It seemed like I was memorizing while this seems more like a consistent system that I learn to apply. We will see.

In Deep Learning I started the section on Bias, Variance, MSE, and the start of Maximum Likelyhood Theory. I had to stop though. I felt like I wasn't absorbing it either and I want to understand Maximum Likelyhood well.

These constant distracting thoughts have been such a problem for me. I feel worn out by them and unlike myself.

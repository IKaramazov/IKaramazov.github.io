I had another average day where I felt like I was pushing through a mental block. I did work on the embeddings notebook. The programming took me a long time but I felt like it was good practice. I didn't finish but I think I will tomorrow. I feel a lot more confident about the TV scripts project now.

Reading Deep Learning was also not a great experience. I read the cost function, and output unit sections. They're concepts that I've covered before but didn't feel like I was absorbing it. I think that I will reread that section tomorrow. I'd rather get a little behind than not understand. 

I was also invited over to play some games with friends but I left early. I'm poor company of late. Too quiet and I start daydreaming. I don't feel connected to anyone anymore.

Tomorrow I'm getting up early again and running on the Golden Gate Bridge. I hope that I can get there right when it opens this time.
